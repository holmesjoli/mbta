                                <p><span class="tab">ransportation </span> maps have changed a lot over the last 100 years due to Harry Beck. Beck was a mechanical draughtsman who redesigned the London Underground Railroad Map in the 1930s. Until that time, the two primary marks used in most transportation diagrams, points, and lines, encoded geographic information about where the stops were relative to the other stops. Position is often a powerful visual variable used to communicate quantitative information.</p>
                                <p>However, Beck realized that from a functional perspective, most diagram users didn't need to know how far stops were from each other geographically. Users needed to know which stop was next and how they could transfer between trains to get to their final destination. Mapping the stations geographically led to crowding information in the center of the map, resulting in ambiguity as to which stations the names belonged.</p>

                            <p>Beck's approach was to organize the diagram as an abstract system. Each line was drawn at a 45-degree or 90-degree angle from every other stop. Additionally, Beck omitted additional geographical information, except for the Thames River. Moreover, interchange, or transfer stations, were demarcated with a different symbol.</p>
                            <p>The result was a map that received widespread acclaim, and most transit systems globally have adopted a similar approach for their transit diagrams.</p>
